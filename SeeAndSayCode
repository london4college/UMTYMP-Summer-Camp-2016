'''
See and say code:

This code allows you to take see and say codes and convert them into pictures just by typing them in.
It also allows you to type in pictures and the computer will convert them into see and say code.

Inside the function printAns() there is a variable called colAmt that determines how many columns are in the picture
when drawing it. If there’s a picture that’s not 6 columns wide, this value should be changed.
